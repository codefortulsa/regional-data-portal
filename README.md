# regional-data-portal
A regional data portal for Tulsa.

Code for Tulsa, and the Oklahoma Innovation Institute are partnering to build an open data portal for the Tulsa region.  This will allow nonprofits, Tulsa County, neighboring municipaities, as well as organizations who work with the city (such as INCOG) to publish open data feeds and resouces.

This repository will serve as a collaboration space to work on the project:  brainstorm new ideas, post and learn best practices, and plan our next steps.  We also have a discussion area in slack: https://tulsadata.slack.com/
